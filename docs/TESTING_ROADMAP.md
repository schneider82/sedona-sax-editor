# Testing Roadmap - Sedona SAX Editor

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of comprehensive testing for the Sedona SAX Editor project. The goal is to establish robust testing practices covering backend APIs, frontend components, SAX file processing, and real-time collaboration features.

- [ ] **Core Component Tests**
  - [ ] `CanvasEditor.vue` - Main canvas functionality
  - [ ] `ComponentPalette.vue` - Component drag/drop
  - [ ] `PropertyPanel.vue` - Component configuration
  - [ ] `ConnectionManager.vue` - Wire connections

## Phase 2: SAX Processing (Weeks 3-4)

### XML Parser Testing
- [ ] **Kit Manifest Parsing**
  - [ ] Parse control kit components (Add2, Sub2, Mul2, etc.)
  - [ ] Parse BarTech control components
  - [ ] Validate component slot definitions
  - [ ] Handle malformed XML gracefully

- [ ] **SAX Import/Export**
  - [ ] Import valid SAX files
  - [ ] Export projects to valid SAX format
  - [ ] Validate component connections
  - [ ] Test large file handling (1000+ components)

- [ ] **Component Validation**
  - [ ] Type compatibility checking
  - [ ] Slot connection validation
  - [ ] Required property verification

---

## Phase 3: Visual Programming Logic (Weeks 5-6)

### Canvas Interaction Testing
- [ ] **Component Management**
  - [ ] Add components to canvas
  - [ ] Move components
  - [ ] Delete components
  - [ ] Copy/paste functionality

- [ ] **Connection System**
  - [ ] Create valid connections
  - [ ] Reject invalid connections (type mismatch)
  - [ ] Visual connection rendering
  - [ ] Connection deletion

- [ ] **State Management (Pinia)**
  - [ ] Project state persistence
  - [ ] Undo/redo functionality
  - [ ] Component property changes
  - [ ] Canvas zoom/pan state

---

## Phase 4: Real-time Collaboration (Weeks 7-8)

### WebSocket Testing
- [ ] **Multi-user Scenarios**
  - [ ] Component addition broadcast
  - [ ] Property change synchronization
  - [ ] Connection creation sharing
  - [ ] User cursor tracking

- [ ] **Conflict Resolution**
  - [ ] Simultaneous edits handling
  - [ ] Component deletion conflicts
  - [ ] Property update races

---

## Phase 5: Integration & E2E (Weeks 9-10)

### End-to-End Workflows
- [ ] **Complete User Journeys**
  - [ ] Import â†’ Edit â†’ Export workflow
  - [ ] New project creation and sharing
  - [ ] Complex project with 100+ components

- [ ] **Browser Testing (Laravel Dusk)**
  - [ ] Drag and drop interactions
  - [ ] Multi-tab collaboration
  - [ ] File upload/download

---

## Phase 6: Performance & Edge Cases (Weeks 11-12)

### Performance Testing
- [ ] **Load Testing**
  - [ ] Large SAX file import (5MB+)
  - [ ] Canvas with 500+ components
  - [ ] Real-time collaboration with 10+ users

- [ ] **Edge Case Handling**
  - [ ] Network disconnection scenarios
  - [ ] Corrupted SAX files
  - [ ] Invalid component configurations
  - [ ] Memory leak prevention

---

## Continuous Integration Setup

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- [ ] **Automated Testing Pipeline**
  - [ ] Run PHPUnit tests on push
  - [ ] Run Vitest frontend tests
  - [ ] Code coverage reporting
  - [ ] Failed test notifications

### Quality Gates
- [ ] **Coverage Requirements**
  - [ ] Backend API coverage > 90%
  - [ ] Frontend component coverage > 85%
  - [ ] SAX parser coverage > 95%

---

## Test Data & Fixtures

### Sample SAX Files
- [ ] **Basic Components**
  - [ ] Simple arithmetic operations
  - [ ] Logic gates and timers
  - [ ] PID controllers

- [ ] **Complex Scenarios**
  - [ ] HVAC control system
  - [ ] Industrial automation sequence
  - [ ] Multi-loop control systems

## Team Assignments

| Phase | Assigned To | Status | Due Date |
|-------|-------------|---------|----------|
| Phase 1 | TBD | Not Started | TBD |
| Phase 2 | TBD | Not Started | TBD |
| Phase 3 | TBD | Not Started | TBD |

## Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- Using Vitest over Jest for better Vue 3 + Vite integration
- SQLite in-memory database for fast test execution
- Separate test suites for unit vs integration tests

### Risk Mitigation
- Canvas testing complexity â†’ Use headless browser for critical interactions
- Real-time testing flakiness â†’ Mock WebSocket connections in unit tests
- Large file performance â†’ Progressive loading and virtualization
